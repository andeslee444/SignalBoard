### üîÑ In Progress (Phase 6: Testing & Documentation)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (target 80% coverage)
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] Add tutorial/help system
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all critical paths

### üìã High Priority Improvements

#### Data Pipeline Enhancements
- [ ] **Implement real Polygon.io API integration** - Currently using mock data
- [ ] **Add more drug mappings** - Current table only has 10 drugs
- [ ] **Implement dead letter queue** - For failed catalyst processing
- [ ] **Add more data sources** - Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage

#### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Implement Redis caching layer** - For frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Add pagination to catalyst queries** - Virtual scrolling implemented but needs backend pagination
- [ ] **Optimize similarity search** - Add HNSW index for better performance
- [ ] **Implement service worker** - For offline functionality

#### Monitoring & Reliability
- [ ] **Set up error tracking** - Sentry integration for production
- [ ] **Add health check endpoints** - Monitor all services
- [ ] **Create data quality dashboard** - Track scraper success rates
- [ ] **Add performance monitoring** - Track Core Web Vitals

### üìÖ Future Phases (from PRD)

#### Week 7-8: Prediction Game
- [ ] Design gamification mechanics
- [ ] Implement prediction submission flow
- [ ] Create scoring algorithm
- [ ] Build user achievement system
- [ ] Add leaderboard functionality
- [ ] Create badges and rewards

#### Week 9-10: Portfolio Integration
- [ ] CSV import functionality
- [ ] Broker API integration (Plaid)
- [ ] Portfolio holdings parser
- [ ] Personalized alert system
- [ ] Risk exposure analysis
- [ ] Portfolio performance tracking

#### Week 11-12: Launch Preparation
- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Load testing (500+ concurrent users)
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Marketing website
- [ ] Beta user onboarding

### üêõ Known Issues
- [ ] **Demo credentials hardcoded** - Move to environment variables
- [ ] **FDA scraper date range** - Hardcoded fallback ranges need dynamic adjustment
- [ ] **Duplicate catalyst detection** - Need better deduplication logic beyond ticker+date
- [ ] **Time zone handling** - Ensure consistent timezone usage across all data sources

### üí° Feature Ideas (Post-MVP)
- [ ] **Multi-language support** - Translate catalyst summaries
- [ ] **Mobile app** - React Native or Flutter
- [ ] **Browser extension** - Quick catalyst checks while browsing
- [ ] **Slack/Discord integration** - Alert notifications
- [ ] **AI chat assistant** - Natural language queries about catalysts
- [ ] **Collaborative predictions** - Team-based forecasting
- [ ] **Options flow integration** - Unusual options activity alerts

### üìö Documentation Tasks
- [ ] **Create API documentation** - Document all Edge Function endpoints
- [ ] **Add architecture diagram** - Visual representation of data flow
- [ ] **Write deployment guide** - Step-by-step production deployment
- [ ] **Create video tutorials** - User onboarding videos
- [ ] **Add code comments** - Improve inline documentation

### üß™ Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit tests for Edge Functions** - Minimum 80% coverage
- [ ] **Integration tests for data pipeline** - End-to-end scraper tests
- [ ] **Load testing** - Ensure system handles 500 concurrent users
- [ ] **UI/UX testing** - Timeline performance with 1000+ catalysts
- [ ] **Security testing** - Penetration testing for auth system
- [ ] **Accessibility testing** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## üìù Notes

### Development Tips
- Run linting before commits: `npm run lint`
- Test Edge Functions locally: `supabase functions serve`
- Monitor Supabase usage dashboard to avoid cost overruns
- Use React DevTools Profiler for performance optimization
- Check bundle size with: `npm run analyze`

### Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented glass morphism design system
- Real-time WebSocket updates working smoothly
- ML predictions integrated with 80%+ confidence scores
- Authentication system with proper security measures
- Mobile-responsive design with touch gestures

### Lessons Learned
- Supabase Edge Functions work great for MVP
- Glass morphism requires careful performance consideration
- Real-time subscriptions need proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks
- TypeScript catches many bugs early
- Framer Motion provides smooth animations with minimal effort
