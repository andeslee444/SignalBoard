# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

The GitHub Actions workflow is ready and has built the site successfully. To complete the deployment, you need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/andeslee444/SignalBoard/settings/pages

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - (Not "Deploy from a branch")

3. **Save Changes**:
   - The settings will be saved automatically

4. **Trigger Deployment**:
   - The deployment will run automatically
   - Or manually trigger it:
     ```bash
     gh workflow run deploy.yml
     ```

5. **Access Your Site**:
   - Once deployed, your site will be available at:
   - https://andeslee444.github.io/SignalBoard/

## Verification:

After enabling GitHub Pages, you can check the deployment status:

```bash
# Check workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml

# View latest run details
gh run view --workflow=deploy.yml
```

## Troubleshooting:

If the deployment fails:
1. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to use "GitHub Actions" as the source
2. Check that the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
3. Review the workflow logs for any errors

The site is already built and ready - you just need to enable GitHub Pages to complete the deployment!
